          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>
            Project Newcastle uses the <a
              href="https://www.openshift.com/">openshift</a> service
            for prototyping and development. The project sources are
            available in <a href="https://github.com/pgier/newcastle">github</a>.
            You can easily set up your own openshift application
            environment and build and deploy updates to your project
            newcastle instance.
          </p>

          <h3>Using the Demo</h3>
          <p>
            Project Newcastle is currently in the very early stages of
            development, so there is only limited functionality. As more
            functionality is added, additional links should be places on
            this welcome page for easy navigation. You can see a list of
            the current database tables <a href="showTables.xhtml">here</a>.
          </p>

          <p>If you created the application from the web console,
            you'll need to manually clone the repository to your local
            system. Copy the application's source code Git URL and then
            run:</p>
